# MCP Standards

- Use MCP tools for up-to-date docs, external systems, and structured actions (GitHub, Notion, Figma, browser, Sentry, Context7).
- Prefer official docs and primary sources when using MCP docs tools.
- Allowlist only the tools needed for the task; disable the rest.
- Never send secrets to MCP tools; use placeholders.
- Log which MCP tools were used and why.
